# Fire-Smoke_Guard_AI
This project uses AI-driven fire and smoke detection with YOLO, integrated with real-time updates via Supabase and mapping with Leaflet. It aims to provide early wildfire detection, fast response times, and accurate location tracking, helping authorities and the public stay informed and take immediate action to prevent damage and loss.
